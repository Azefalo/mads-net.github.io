  This short guide shows how to check the latest MADS release, grab the direct
  download link that `mads -u` prints for your OS, install it, verify the
  version, and reboot or restart services safely.
---

# Motivation

Keeping all devices on the **same, current MADS version** avoids random bugs, API mismatches,
and security holes. Teams often run MADS on **different hardware (servers, Raspberry Pis, laptops)**,
and skipping an update on just one of them can break the whole network. This guide gives you a **single,
repeatable procedure** to update each device quickly, verify what you installed, and restart only the
services you need—so you minimize downtime and confusion.

# TL;DR

1. Check if there is an update and get the download links:
   ```sh
   mads -u
   ```
2. **Copy the link for your OS/architecture** (as shown by `mads -u`).
3. On **each device**:
   ```sh
   wget <link>
   sudo dpkg -i <package-file.deb>
   mads -i
   ```
4. **Reboot** the device, or **restart the services** on servers:
   ```sh
   sudo reboot
   # or, on servers
   sudo systemctl restart mads-broker
   sudo systemctl restart mads-logger
   ```

# 1. Check if you are up to date (and get the links)

Run:

```sh
mads -u
```

This command:

* tells you if you already have the latest MADS version or
* if a newer version is available. In this case, it prints the **direct download links** for each supported OS/architecture (e.g., `Linux-aarch64`, `Linux-x86_64`).

If you're up to date, everything is good in your device. If a newer release is available, just **copy the link that matches your device**.

::: callout-note
**Mac OS**       : Darwin-universal

**Raspberry Pi** : Linux-aarch64

**Linux PC**     : Linux-x86_64

**Windows**      : Windows-AMD64

# 2. Download the right package

On each device, download the `.deb` file using the link you copied from `mads -u`:

```sh
wget <link>
```

**Example** made for a Raspberry Pi (Linux-aarch64):

```bash
wget https://github.com/pbosetti/MADS/releases/download/v1.3.1/mads-1.3.1-Linux-aarch64.deb
```

::: callout-note
Alternative (manual):

You can still go to **GitHub → MADS → [Releases](https://github.com/pbosetti/MADS/releases)** and pick the right asset from there, but using `mads -u` is faster and less error‑prone.

# 3. Install

Install the file you just downloaded:

```sh
sudo dpkg -i <package-file.deb>
```

**Example** made for a Raspberry Pi (Linux-aarch64):

```bash
sudo dpkg -i mads-1.3.1-Linux-aarch64.deb
```

---

# 4. Verify the installed version

```sh
mads -i
```

You should see something like:

```
Mads version: <version number>
```

---

# 5. Reboot or restart services

**Embedded devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi):**

```sh
sudo reboot
```

**Linux servers running only the broker and logger:**

```sh
sudo systemctl restart mads-broker
sudo systemctl restart mads-logger
```

Confirm they are running:

```sh
sudo systemctl status mads-broker
sudo systemctl status mads-logger
```

You should see `active (running)` with a recent time stamp.
